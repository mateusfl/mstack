# Swarm

Fan out N parallel cloud workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from `swarm workers` in `~/.cursor/rules/mstack-models.mdc` when present. Otherwise use `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh`. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes.

## Phase B: Fan out

Before spawning, inspect whether the target evidence and checkout are local or cloud. Spawn each worker with the environment that can actually reach its assigned files, process, credentials, and live surface. Do not default to cloud or local by habit. Every worker reports `pwd`, branch, status, worktree, and environment before writing or verifying. Use `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `run_in_background: true`, and the configured model. For browser, web, or Electron evidence, prioritize `control-lize` and follow the screenshot, state, decision, action, repeat cycle in `skills/mauri-mode/references/control-lize.md`.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass `cloud_base_branch`.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. For browser, web, or Electron verification, tell the worker to use `control-lize` first when it is on PATH and follow `skills/mauri-mode/references/control-lize.md`. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
